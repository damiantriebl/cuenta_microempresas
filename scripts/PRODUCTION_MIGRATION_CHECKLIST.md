- [ ] Caching systems functioning properly
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly

### 11. User Acceptance
- [ ] Key users notified of completion
- [ ] User testing completed successfully
- [ ] No critical user-reported issues

## Cleanup and Documentation

### 12. Migration Cleanup
- [ ] Migration logs archived
- [ ] Temporary migration data cleaned up
- [ ] Migration status documented
- [ ] Backup retention policy applied
- [ ] Monitoring alerts updated

### 13. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Migration completion documented
- [ ] Database schema documentation updated
- [ ] API documentation updated if needed
- [ ] User documentation updated
- [ ] Runbook updated with lessons learned

### 14. Team Communication
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of successful completion
- [ ] Migration report distributed
- [ ] Lessons learned session scheduled
- [ ] Success metrics documented
- [ ] Team debriefing completed

## Emergency Procedures

### If Migration Fails
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Stop migration process if safe to do so
   - [ ] Assess current state and impact
   - [ ] Determine if rollback is necessary
   - [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders

2. **Rollback Decision**
   - [ ] Evaluate rollback vs. fix-forward options
   - [ ] Consider user impact and business requirements
   - [ ] Get approval from decision makers
   - [ ] Execute chosen recovery strategy

3. **Rollback Execution** (if needed)
   - [ ] Identify appropriate backup for rollback
   - [ ] Execute rollback using: `npm run migrate:rollback -- --backup-id <id>`
   - [ ] Validate rollback success
   - [ ] Verify application functionality
   - [ ] Communicate rollback completion

### If Partial Migration Occurs
1. **Assessment**
   - [ ] Identify which companies migrated successfully
   - [ ] Determine impact on application functionality
   - [ ] Assess data consistency issues
   - [ ] Evaluate user impact

2. **Recovery Options**
   - [ ] Complete migration for remaining companies
   - [ ] Rollback successful migrations
   - [ ] Implement temporary fixes
   - [ ] Schedule retry with fixes

## Migration Commands Reference

### Development Testing
```bash
# Test migration functionality
npm run migrate:test

# Dry run to see what would be migrated
npm run migrate:dry-run

# Test specific company
npm run migrate:dry-run -- --company-id "company123"
```

### Production Migration
```bash
# Full production migration
npm run migrate:production -- --confirm-production

# Production migration with custom settings
npm run migrate:production -- --confirm-production --batch-size 10 --delay 2000

# Migrate specific company in production
npm run migrate:production -- --confirm-production --company-id "company123"
```

### Rollback Operations
```bash
# List available backups
npm run migrate:rollback -- --list

# Rollback specific backup
npm run migrate:rollback -- --backup-id "backup123"

# Use latest backup for company
npm run migrate:rollback -- --company-id "company123" --latest

# Show rollback plan without executing
npm run migrate:rollback -- --backup-id "backup123" --dry-run
```

## Success Criteria

The migration is considered successful when:

- [ ] All companies have the required `nombre` field
- [ ] All products have required `ultimoCosto` and `ultimaGanancia` fields
- [ ] No data corruption or loss occurred
- [ ] Application functionality is fully restored
- [ ] User workflows are functioning normally
- [ ] Performance is within acceptable limits
- [ ] All backups are created and validated
- [ ] Migration report shows acceptable success rate (>95%)

## Rollback Criteria

Consider rollback if:

- [ ] Migration success rate < 90%
- [ ] Critical application functionality broken
- [ ] Data corruption detected
- [ ] Unacceptable performance degradation
- [ ] User-blocking issues identified
- [ ] Business operations significantly impacted
